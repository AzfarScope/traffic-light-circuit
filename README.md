# traffic-light-circuit
This is a traffic light circuit using the decade counter ic CD4026BE and the timer ic NE555.
The circuit is made in Eagle Autodesk PCB design software.

Main point of this repository is for people to criticise and improve my schematic and circuit design to ensure proper results when I send it to a PCB manufacturing service such as JLCPCB or PCBWAY.
